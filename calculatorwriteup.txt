In this program, we are making a simple calculator using switch..case in Java. 
This calculator would be able to add, subtract, multiply and divide two number
s.Here, we have used the Scanner class to take 3 inputs from the user.

operator - specifies the operation to be performed
number1/number2 - operands to perform operation on

Since the operator matches the case '+', so the corresponding codes are executed.
These statements compute the sum of two numbers and print the output. Finally, 
the break statement ends the switch statement.

Similarly, for different operators, different cases are executed.
